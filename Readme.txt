I used Open CV to decode a media File to Raw RGB/YUV Formats,
Then Processed the data using my own media Filter code
Please do let me know if ffmpeg usage is mandatory
I need little time probably on a weekend i can try.

Usage: <.exe> <inputfile> <xpos> <ypos> <roi_width> <roi_height> <outputfile> \n");
sample for reference::  small.mp4 0 0 100 100 out.yuv

How to Run
2) copy the executable along with the libraries into a folder
3) From windows command prompt run the exe in specified format.
4) Out put file will be dumped in the same folder.


Shared the code in locla git repo

YUV viewer used for testing is also shared,
its a trial version, when we open just need to click try it, 
then drag and drop the yuv file and choose the formatand Resolution.
